Movierama is yet another movie catalog where users can check the movies of the week, search for movies and view details about them. The project doesn't have any backend parts but instead relies solely on [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (TMDB) JSON [API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) for a data source. The application is built using TypeScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

## Features

- **In Theaters**: Find a list of movies currently being played in cinemas.

- **Movie Discovery**: Browse through a wide range of movies and explore detailed information about each movie, including overview, trailers, reviews, and ratings.

- **Keyword Search**: Type in the search bar to filter through TMDB's huge catalog of movies.

- **YouTube Trailers**: Find trailers and watch them right inside the app.

- **User Reviews**: Read user reviews for any movie.

- **Similar Movies**: Each movie has its own suggested list of similar movies.
